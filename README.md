# Portfolio: Legacy Projects (Original Source)

> **Note:** This repository is preserved as a historical record. It contains the original source code created several months ago, uploaded **without modification** to file names, logic, or structure. This serves as a baseline for my evolution as a software developer.

## Development Journey
This collection represents my initial transition from core logic in C to interactive GUIs in Java. By viewing this repository, you can analyze my original coding behavior, including how I handled state management, file organization, and logic before adopting modern industrial standards.

## Projects

### 1. Advanced Game Development (C, Java)
These projects were developed across multiple platforms to establish core logic and interactivity.
* **Tic-Tac-Toe and SOS:** * **C Console:** Core logic development and win-condition checks.
	* **Java Console:** Porting the logic to an Object-Oriented environment.
    * **Java GUI (AWT/Applets):** Building the graphical user interface for user interaction.

### 2. AI Algorithms (Tic-Tac-Toe)
I implemented two distinct algorithms to showcase iterative problem-solving:
* **Algorithm 1 (Heuristic-based AI):** A rule-based AI that focuses on blocking the player and identifying immediate winning moves.
* **Algorithm 2 (Strategic AI):** An advanced AI utilizing game theory strategies to guarantee a win or a tie.

### 3. Dots and Boxes Game (Java)
A two-player game with a graphical interface. The logic tracks the game state, identifies completed boxes, and updates the score in real-time using Java AWT/GUI.

## Comparison and Growth
I have since refactored these projects to meet modern industrial standards and clean code principles.

## Setup and Execution

### Prerequisites
You must install the following tools to compile and run these projects:
* **JDK (Java Development Kit):** [Download JDK here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)
* **GCC (C Compiler):** [Installation Guide for GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/install/)

### Important Note on File Names
Since these files are uploaded in their **original, unedited state** from several months ago, some filenames may contain spaces. To run them without error, you must either:
1. Rename the files to remove spaces (e.g., rename `My File.java` to `MyFile.java`).
2. Use quotation marks around the filename in your terminal.

### Running the Code
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/Sai-Sampath-Vegi/Sai-Sampath-old-portfolio.git](https://github.com/Sai-Sampath-Vegi/Sai-Sampath-old-portfolio.git)
   ```
2. **Run the Commands:**
    For Java Projects:
       javac "Original File Name.java"
       java "OriginalFileName"
    For C Projects:
       gcc "Original File Name.c" -o output
       ./output

## Conclusion
This repository serves as a personal archive to document my technical starting point. It remains unedited to provide an honest look at my development history and the logic I used before adopting industrial standards. For a look at how I have modernized these exact projects, please visit my refactored repository.
